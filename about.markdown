I'm a software developer in the greater Nashville area and a graduate student at Vanderbilt university. I spend a **lot** of time coding for fun (just look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/jmbeach) contributions) and for work. Often, I find myself trying to do something either not very well documented, or a little niche and I have to piece together a lot of information on my own. This blog is where I share those solutions, improve some StackOverflow answers, and talk about the software projects and problems that are currently haunting my dreams.
